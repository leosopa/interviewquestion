# interviewquestion
WPF Solution to answer an interview question.

This is my solution to answer an interview question about WPF.

I tried two development approaches in this repo:

1 - Maintenance environment project:

      In this approach, I tried to solve the problem without significant changes in the project structure and used the best practices. 
      
2 - MVVM environment project:

     I tried to solve the problem using the MVVM pattern in this second approach.
